			<p class="description">Elephants are at their most fertile between the ages of 25 and 45. A herd may deplete an area of foliage depriving other herbivores for a time. African elephants may eat up to 450 kg (992 lb) of vegetation per day. An elephant's digestive system is not very efficient; only 40% of this food is properly digested. </p>
